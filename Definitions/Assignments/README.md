## Components

This chapter describes how **Policy Assignments** are handled by PaC. To learn about how custom Policy and Initiative definitions are managed, see the [Policy Definitions](../Policies/README.md) and [Initiative Definitions](../Initiatives/README.md).

The components required for **creating / updating / deleting Policy assignments and Policy set (initiative) assignments** are the following:

| Component | What is it used for? | Where can it be found? |
|--|--|--|
| **Assignment JSON files** | The assignments JSON file follows the management group hierarchy (optionally including subscriptions and resource groups) and defines all policy and initiative assignments on these scopes. | `Definitions/Assignments` folder |
| **Global Settings File** | The `global-settings.jsonc` file specifies common values for Policy Assignments  | `Definitions` folder |

## Assignment File Overview Diagram

Assignment files are hierarchical for efficient JSON definitions, avoiding duplication of JSON with copy/paste.

## Assignment JSON file structure

`scope` and `notScope` use a `PacAssignmentSelector` to specify which scope to use for different environments and tenants. The value for the `PacAssignmentSelector` is passed to the build script as a parameter. A star matches any `PacAssignmentSelector` specified.

## Assignment Node Components

| Key | Description | Rule |
|-----|-------------|------|
| `nodeName` | arbitrary name of the node for usage by the scripts to pinpoint format errors. | Must exist in each node. |
| `managedIdentityLocation` | Selects the Managed Identity location for Policies with `DeployIfnotExists` and `Modify` effects. | Any node: overrides previous setting. |
| `scope` | List of scopes for assignment. | Must exist exactly once in each branch of the tree. |
| `notScope` | List of notScopes. | Cumulative in branch. May not appear at a child node once the `scope` has been determined. |
| `assignment` | Assignment `name`, `displayName` and `description`. | String values are concatenated in each branch. Assignment `name` lengths are limited to 24. Must exist at least once in every branch. |
| `parameters` | Parameter values for the assignment. Specified parameters not defined in the assigned Policy or Initiative are silently ignored. | Union of all the `parameters` defined in a branch. `parameters` redefined at a child (recursive) node overwrite the parent nodes value. |
| `ignoreBranch` | Ignore the rest of the tee staring at this node. Can be used to define future assignments without deploying the assignments. | Any node: overrides are ignored. |
| `enforcementMode` | Similar to `ignoreBranch`, it deploys the assignment and sets the assignment to `Default` or `DoNotEnforce`. `DoNotEnforce` allows a whatif analysis. | Any node: overrides previous setting |
| `definitionEntry` | Specifies the `policyName` or `initiativeName` for the assignment. The name should not be a fully qualified `id`. `friendlyNameToDocumentIfGuid` and is purely used as a comment to make the Json more readable if the name is a GUID. | Must exist exactly once in each branch of the tree. |
| `additionalRoleAssignments` | `roleDefinitionIds` are calculated from the included (direct or indirect via Initiative) Policy definition(s). Fo some Policies, such as DINE `diagnosticsSettings` the monitor destination might be in a different branch of the Management Group tree from the Assignment. This field specifies any roles requiring assignments in that MG branch. The value is an array, each element containing two items: `roleDefinitionId` and `scope` | Union of all the `additionalRoleAssignments` defined in this branch |

## Details for `scope` and `notScope` Values

### Using the `PacAssignmentSelector`

The assignment selector determines the array being selected for this run of the script (e.g., `dev`, `test` and, `prod` above). Exact matches to the parameter `PacAssignmentSelector` for `Build-AzPoliciesInitiativesAssignmentsPlan.ps1` select that array for `notScope` and `scope`. A star (`*`) in the assignment or globalSettings.jsonc file  always selects the array independent of the `PacAssignmentSelector`. The star is only useful in single tenant scenarios, except for Resource Group patterns.

### Resource Group patterns in `notScope`

`notScope` also accepts Resource Group name patterns with wild cards. Standard `notScope` definitions require fully qualified paths. This solution can add Resource Groups based on name patterns. The patterns are resolved during deployment. Any Resource Group added after the deployment are not automatically added. You must rerun the deployment pipeline to add new Resource Groups.

### Example Scope Definition

| Scope | Example |
|---|---|
| Management group | `/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/<managementGroupId>` |
| Subscription | `/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>` |
| Resource Group | `/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroupName>` |
