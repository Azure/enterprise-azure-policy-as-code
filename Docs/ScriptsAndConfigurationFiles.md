## Policy and Initiative definition configuration scripts

The `Build-AzPoliciesInitiativesAssignmentsPlan.ps1` analyzes changes in policy, initiative, and assignment files. The  `Deploy-AzPoliciesInitiativesAssignmentsFromPlan.ps1` script is used to deploy policies, initiatives, and assignments at their desired scope, the `Remove-AzPoliciesIdentitiesRoles.ps1` file is used to remove unnecessary roles and identities given out previously, and the `Plan File.json` is an artifact created by the pipeline run that is used to show the expected changes in Azure.

The deployment scripts are **declarative** and **idempotent**: this means, that regardless how many times they are run, they always push all changes that were implemented in the JSON files to the Azure environment, i.e. if a JSON file is newly created/updated/deleted, the pipeline will create/update/delete the Policy and/or Initiative definition in Azure. If there are no changes, the pipeline can be run any number of times, as it won't make any changes to Azure.

## Global Settings Configuration File

The `global-settings.jsonc` file is located in the definitions folder and defines settings for all policy as code deployments with the following items:
- Managed Identity Locations
    + In this file, you must specify the locations for managed identities. This can be done for the entire platform by using the "*" operator or it can be specified on an environment level.
    + Typically this will be set to your primary tenant location
- Not scope
    + Not Scope is designed to act as a permanent exclusion from policy evaluation. As opposed to an exemption which has a set end date. This can also be set across the entire platform or at an environment level.
```json

    "managedIdentityLocation": {
        "*": "eastus2"
    },
