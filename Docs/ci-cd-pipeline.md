# CI/CD Pipeline and Azure DevOps

This page covers the general CI/CD documentation, as well as, Azure DevOps CI/CD specific items.

This repository contains starter pipelines

* Azure DevOps
* [GitHub Actions](./github-actions.md). 


The authors are interested in supporting other deployment pipelines. If you have developed pipelines for other technologies, such as GitLab, Jenkins, etc., please contribute them to the project as additional starter kits.

## Simplified GitHub Flow for Policy as Code

The diagram below shows the use of GitHub Flow in Policy as Code. Builds are triggered for Commits, optionally for Pull Requests and for successful main branch merges.

## Service connections for DevOps CI/CD

Create Service Principals for the pipeline execution and setup your DevOps environment with the necessary service connections. You will need SPNs with specific roles as shown below.

* Single tenant [pipeline service connections](#single-tenant-service-connections-and-roles).
* Multi tenant [pipeline service connections](#multi-tenant-service-connections-and-roles).

When creating a Service Connection in Azure DevOps you can set up the service connections on a Subscription or a Management Group scope level. If you are using subscriptions to simulate a hierarchy during EPAC development, configure the service connection(s) scope level as **Subscription**. When creating a Service Connections for management groups (any EPAC environments) Deployment and EPAC Role Assignment the service connection scope level is **Management Group**.

Subscription scope level | Management Group scope level

## Single Tenant Pipeline

### Single Tenant Stages

| Stage | Purpose | Trigger | Scripts |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| devStage | Feature branch DEV environment build, deploy and test | CI, Manual | Build-DeploymentPlans.ps1 <br> Deploy-PolicyPlan.ps1 <br/> Deploy-RolesPlan.ps1 |
| tenantPlanFeatureStage | Feature branch based plan for prod deployment | CI, Manual | Build-DeploymentPlans.ps1 |
| tenantPlanMainStage | Main branch based plan for prod deployment | PR Merged, Manual | Build-DeploymentPlans.ps1 |
| tenantDeployStage | Deploy Policies defined by Main branch based plan | Prod stage approved | Deploy-PolicyPlan.ps1 |
| tenantRolesStage | Assign roles defined by Main branch based plan | Role stage approved | Deploy-RolesPlan.ps1 |

### Single Tenant Service Connections and Roles

Create Service Principals and associated service connections in Azure DevOps or the equivalent in your CI/CD tool. The SPNs require the following roles to adhere to the least privilege principle. If you have a single tenant, remove the last column and rows with connections ending in "-2".

| Connection | Stages  | MG: epac-dev-mg | MG: Tenant Root |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| sc-pac-dev | devStage  | Owner <br/> [Graph Permissions](#ms-graph-permissions) ||||
| sc-pac-plan | tenantPlanFeatureStage <br/> tenantPlanMainStage || [EPAC Policy Reader](#custom-epac-resource-policy-reader-role) <br/> [Graph Permissions](#ms-graph-permissions) |
| sc-pac-prod | tenantDeployStage || Policy Contributor |
| sc-pac-roles | tenantRolesStage-1 || User Access Administrator |

## Multi Tenant Pipeline

### Multi Tenant Stages

## Role Assignments for CI/CD SPNs

**Breaking change:** For the planning stages, the SPN used must use a simpler reader role definition and have MS Graph permissions.

### MS Graph permissions

EPAC uses `Get-AzRoleAssignment` to retrieve role assignments. Microsoft has recently changed the internals from using the deprecated AAD API to use MS Graph. MS Graph queries are more complex and improve security. The cmdlet may call the following Microsoft Graph API according to input parameters:

* GET /users/{id}
* GET /servicePrincipals/{id}
* GET /groups/{id}
* GET /directoryObjects/{id}
* POST /directoryObjects/getByIds

You must assign these MS Graph `Application permissions` corresponding to the above APIs:

* User.Read.All
* ServicePrincipalEndpoint.Read.All
* Group.Read.All
* Directory.Read.All

After you configure the Permissions (`Add a permission`), you must `Grant admin consent for ...`. The result in Azure AD portal looks like this:

![image,png](Images/ms-graph-permissions.png)

Read the following Microsoft instructions to [learn more about MS Graph Application Permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-overview?tabs=http#application-permissions)

1. [Register your app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-service#1-register-your-app)
2. [Configure permissions for Microsoft Graph](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-service#2-configure-permissions-for-microsoft-graph>)
3. [Get administrator consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-service#3-get-administrator-consent)

### Custom EPAC Resource Policy Reader Role

EPAC uses a set of Service Principals to execute the Plan phase which do not require as many rights as those that deploy policy assets into Azure. In version 6, we introduced a **breaking change** that leveraged MS Graph API to retrieve information about the current Azure configuration. This both improves performance, and moves us to the replacement technology for the older Azure Graph API. The addition of **Microsoft.Graph/Operations/read** is the change which enables this functionality.

The list of roles, and their descriptions is available online [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/resource-provider-operations).

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "roleName": "EPAC Resource Policy Reader",
        "description": "Provides read access to all Policy resources for the purpose of planning the EPAC deployments.",
        "assignableScopes": [
            "/"
        ],
        "permissions": [
            {
                "actions": [
                    "Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/read",
                    "Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/read",
                    "Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/read",
                    "Microsoft.Authorization/policyExemptions/read",
                    "Microsoft.PolicyInsights/*",
                    "Microsoft.Management/register/action"
                ],
                "notActions": [],
                "dataActions": [],
                "notDataActions": []
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Operations script `New-AzPolicyReaderRole.ps1` creates the role assignment with the above settings.

## Azure DevOps Pipeline

### Service Connections

Service connections give the pipeline the proper permissions to deploy at desired Azure scopes. Refer to the following documentation:  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml>.

### Deployment Environments

Create distinct ADO environment to configure approval gates. Refer to the following documentation:  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/environments?view=azure-devops>

## Deployment Scripts

While this script intended to be used, they can be run manually to create a semi-automated EPAC solution. This is useful:

* CI/CD environment is not yet available
* Debugging the scripts from Visual Studio Code (or other IDE)

![image.pmg](Images/epac-deployment-scripts.png)

### Common Script Parameters

|Parameter | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| `pacEnvironmentSelector` | Selects the EPAC environment for this plan. If omitted, interactively prompts for the value. |
| `definitionsRootFolder` | Definitions folder path. Defaults to environment variable `$env:PAC_DEFINITIONS_FOLDER` or `./Definitions`. It must contain file `global-settings.jsonc`. |
| `interactive` | Defaults to `$false`. |

### Build-DeploymentPlans.ps1

Analyzes changes in Policy definition, Policy Set definition, and Policy Assignment files. It calculates a plan to apply deltas. The deployment scripts are **declarative** and **idempotent**: this means, that regardless how many times they are run, they always push all changes that were implemented in the JSON files to the Azure environment, i.e. if a JSON file is newly created/updated/deleted, the pipeline will create/update/delete the Policy and/or Policy Set and/or Policy Assignments definition in Azure. If there are no changes, the pipeline can be run any number of times, as it won't make any changes to Azure.

In addition to the [common parameters](#common-script-parameters), these parameters are defined:

|Parameter | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| `outputFolder` | Output folder path for plan files. Defaults to environment variable `$env:PAC_OUTPUT_FOLDER` or `./Output`. |
| `devOpsType` | If set, outputs variables consumable by conditions in a DevOps pipeline. Default: not set. |

### Deploy-PolicyPlan.ps1

Deploys Policies, Policy Sets, Policy Assignments, and Policy Exemptions at their desired scope based on the plan.

|Parameter | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| `inputFolder` | Input folder path for plan files. Defaults to environment variable `$env:PAC_INPUT_FOLDER`, `$env:PAC_OUTPUT_FOLDER` or `./Output`. |

### Deploy-RolesPlan.ps1

Creates the role assignments for the Managed Identities required for `DeployIfNotExists` and `Modify` Policies.

|Parameter | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| `inputFolder` | Input folder path for plan files. Defaults to environment variable `$env:PAC_INPUT_FOLDER`, `$env:PAC_OUTPUT_FOLDER` or `./Output`. |

## Consuming Excel Files

This functionality is no longer integrated in EPAC. `Convert-XlsToCSV.ps1` has been removed from the repo.

## Pipeline Execution

In Azure Devops pipelines the following happens. Your CI/CD tools will display progress differently.

### `Commit` to a feature branch or a manual pipeline run

* Stage devStage to deploy Policies, Policy Sets and Policy Assignments to the PAC DEV environment.
* Calculates the plan for PROD environment deployment based on the Feature branch.
  * This plan is never executed. Instead the logs and if desired the artifact generated are used by the developer to verify the definition files and to determine if the code is ready for a Pull Request.
  * The PR approver(s) will use the same input plus the source code changes to decide the PR approval or rejection.

Detail view:

![image.png](Images/feature-run-details.png)

### `Pull Request` is approved and branch merged into main

* Calculates the plan for PROD environment deployment based on the merged Main branch.
* The pipeline stops for PROD gate(s) approval at this time.
  * The logs and if desired the artifacts generated are used by the PROD gate(s) approver(s) to decide on the PROD stage approval(s) or rejection(s).
* ![image.png](Images/prod-approval.png)
* ![image.png](Images/prod-approval-dialog.png)
* After the approval deployments to PROD will begin.
* Optional a second approval before role assignments is required.
* ![image.png](Images/prod-complete.png)
* After the ntire run the overview page looks like this:
* ![image.png](Images/pipeline-runs.png)

### No changes

* Deployment steps and stages are skipped. Skipped stages do not need approvals.
