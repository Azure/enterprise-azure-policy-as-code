# Extract existing Policy Resources from an Environment

!!! note
    This is a preview version which [may produce strange assignment files](#preview-caveats) in rare circumstances. If you see such a problem, please [raise a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/issues/new).

Extracts existing Policies, Policy Sets, and Policy Assignments and outputs them in EPAC format into subfolders in folder (`$outputFolders/Definitions`). The subfolders are `policyDefinitions`, `policySetDefinitions`, and `policyAssignments`. In a new EPAC instance these subfolders can be directly copied to the `Definitions` folder enabling an initial transition from a pre-EPAC to EPAC environment.

!!! warning
    The script deletes the `$outputFolders/Definitions` folder before creating a new set of files. In interactive mode it will ask for confirmation before deleting the directory.

|Parameter | Required | Explanation |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PacEnvironmentSelector` | Optional | Defines which Policy as Code (PAC) environment we are using; if omitted, the script prompts for a value. The values are read from `$DefinitionsRootFolder/global-settings.jsonc`. |
| `definitionsRootFolder` | Optional | Definitions folder path. Defaults to environment variable `$env:PAC_DEFINITIONS_FOLDER` or `./Definitions`. It contains `global-settings.jsonc`.
| `outputFolder` | Optional | Output Folder. Defaults to environment variable `$env:PAC_OUTPUT_FOLDER` or `./Outputs`.
| `interactive` | Optional | Script is being run interactively and can request az login. It will also prompt for each file to process or skip. Defaults to $true. |
| `includeChildScopes` | Optional | Switch parameter to include Policies and Policy Sets in child scopes; child scopes are normally ignored for definitions. This does not impact Policy Assignments. |
| `fileExtension` | Optional | Controls the output files extension. Default is `jsonc` but `json` is also accepted |

The scripts creates a `Definitions` folder in the `outputFolder` and subfolders for `policyDefinitions`, `policySetDefinitions` and `policyAssignments`. To use the generated files copy them to your `Definitions` folder.

* `policyDefinitions`, `policySetDefinitions` have a subfolder based on `metadata.category`. If the definition has no `category` `metadata` they are put in a subfolder labeled `Unknown Category`. Duplicates when including child scopes are sorted into the `Duplicates` folder. Creates one file per Policy and Policy Set.
* `policyAssignments` have a subfolder `policy` for assignments of a single Policy, or a subfolder `policySet` for assignment of a Policy Set. Creates one file per unique assigned Policy or Policy Set spanning multiple Assignments.

## Preview Caveats

The extractions are subject to the following assumptions and caveats:

* Names of Policies and Policy Sets are unique across multiple scopes (switch `includeChildScopes` is used)
* Assignment names are the same if the parameters match across multiple assignments across scopes for the same `policyDefinitionId` to enable optimization of the JSON.
* Ignores Assignments auto-assigned by Security Center (Defender for Cloud) at subscription level.
* Does not collate across multiple tenants.
* Does not calculate any `additionalRoleAssignments`.
* Only optimizes the tree structure from the three levels in the following order:
  * `policyDefinition` (name or id)
  * `parameters` per parameter set for the `policyDefinition`
  * Assignment name, **scopes**, and other attributes
* In some cases, ordering scope would yield a more compact tree structure:
  * `policyDefinition` (name or id)
  * Assignment name, **scopes**, and other attributes
  * `parameters` per parameter set for the `policyDefinition`
* Doesn't (yet) collate multiple assignments in support of CSV files for parameters. Use `Build-PolicyDocumentation.ps1` to generate CSV files and edit the corresponding assignments to reference the CSV file
* Doesn't generate Exemptions; use `Get-AzExemptions.ps1` instead.
