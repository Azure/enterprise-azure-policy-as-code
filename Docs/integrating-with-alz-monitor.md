# Azure Baseline Monitor Alerts Integration

For users interested in deploying the [Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts](https://azure.github.io/azure-monitor-baseline-alerts/welcome/) project with EPAC - these policies have been extracted and converted to the EPAC format and are available at the [amba-export](https://github.com/anwather/amba-export) repository.

This process will be updated in the future to use the new sync process with the ALZ library.

Please review the ```README``` available in that repository for usage within EPAC.
