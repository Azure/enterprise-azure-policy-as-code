# Operational Scripts

The scripts are detailed in the [reference page](operational-scripts-reference.md) including  syntax, descriptions and parameters.

## Batch Creation of Remediation Tasks

The script `New-AzRemediationTasks` creates remediation tasks for all non-compliant resources for EPAC environments in the `global-settings.jsonc` file.

This script executes all remediation tasks in a Policy as Code environment specified with parameter `PacEnvironmentSelector`. The script will interactively prompt for the value if the parameter is not supplied. The script will recurse the Management Group structure and subscriptions from the defined starting point.

* Find all Policy assignments with potential remediation capable resources
* Query Policy Insights for non-complaint resources
* Start remediation task for each Policy with non-compliant resources
* Switch parameter `-OnlyCheckManagedAssignments` includes non-compliance data only for Policy assignments owned by this Policy as Code repo.

## Documenting Policy

`Build-PolicyDocumentation` builds documentation from instructions in the `policyDocumentations` folder reading the deployed Policy Resources from the EPAC environment. It is also used to generate parameter/effect CSV files for Policy Assignment files. See usage documentation in [Documenting Policy](operational-scripts-documenting-policy.md).

## Policy Resources Exports

- `Export-AzPolicyResources` exports Azure Policy resources in EPAC. It also generates documentation for the exported resources (can be suppressed with `-SuppressDocumentation`). See usage documentation in [Extract existing Policy Resources](start-extracting-policy-resources.md).
- `Get-AzExemptions` retrieves Policy Exemptions from an EPAC environment and saves them to files.
- `Get-AzPolicyAliasOutputCSV` exports Policy Aliases to CSV format.

## Hydration Kit

The Hydration Kit is a set of scripts that can be used to deploy an EPAC environment from scratch. The scripts are documented in the [Hydration Kit](operational-scripts-hydration-kit.md) page.

## CI/CD Helpers

The scripts `New-AzureDevOpsBug` and `New-GitHubIssue` create a Bug or Issue when there are one or multiple failed Remediation Tasks.

## Non-compliance Reports

`Export-NonComplianceReports` exports non-compliance reports for EPAC environments . It outputs the reports in the `$OutputFolders/non-compliance-reports` folder.

- `summary-by-policy.csv` contains the summary of the non-compliant resources by Policy definition. The columns contain the resource counts.
- `summary-by-resource.csv` contains the summary of the non-compliant resources. The columns contain the number of Policies causing the non-compliance.
- `details-by-policy.csv` contains the details of the non-compliant resources by Policy definition including the non-compliant resource ids. Assignments are combined by Policy definition.
- `details-by-resource.csv` contains the details of the non-compliant resources sorted by Resource id. Assignments are combined by Resource id.
- `full-details-by-assignment.csv` contains the details of the non-compliant resources sorted by Policy Assignment id.
- `full-details-by-resource.csv` contains the details of the non-compliant resources sorted by Resource id including the Policy Assignment details.
