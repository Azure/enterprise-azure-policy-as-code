# Policy Assignments

This chapter describes how **Policy Assignments** are handled by EPAC. Policy Assignments are the actual assignments of Policies and Policy Sets to scopes in Azure.

## Assignment JSON structure

Assignment JSON is hierarchical for efficient definitions, avoiding duplication (copy/paste) of JSON. Each branch of the tree is cumulative. Each tree node must include a `nodeName` - an arbitrary string exclusively used by EPAC to display an error location. EPAC concatenates a leading `/` and the nodeName entries encountered in the tree to create a "breadcrumbs" trail; therefore, we recommend that you use `/` to help separate the concatenated `nodeName`. The following partial and invalid assignment tree would create this error message.

```json
{
  "nodeName": "/Security/",
  "definitionEntry": {
    "policySetName": "org-sec-initiative",
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "nodeName": "Prod/",
      "parameters": {
        "some-effect": "Deny",
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### JSON Schema

The GitHub repo contains a JSON schema which can be used in tools such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) to provide code completion.

To utilize the schema add a ```$schema``` tag to the JSON file.

```
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/enterprise-azure-policy-as-code/main/Schemas/policy-assignment-schema.json"
}
```

## Policy Assignment File Folder Structure Guidelines

In any EPAC deployment you will have a number of assignment files. When a deployment plan is built EPAC does a recursive search for all the files in the `policyAssignments` folder. This means that you are free to use any folder structure you think is appropriate to help organise the files. For example if you have a multi-tenant or multi-environment setup you might choose to create folders representing each tenant or environment and then store the assignment files for each environment in that folder.

## Key Points

- Every tree branch must accumulate a `definitionEntry` (or `definitionEntryList`), Assignment naming (`name` and `displayName`) and `scope` element.
- The elements `parameters`, `overrides`, `resourceSelectors`, `notScope`, `enforcementMode`, `metadata`, `userAssignedIdentity`, `managedIdentityLocations`,`additionalRoleAssignments`and`nonComplianceMessages` are optional.
- For Policy Sets with large numbers of included Policies you should use a spreadsheet (CSV file) to manage **effects** (parameterized or effect `overrides`), `parameters` and optional `nonComplianceMessages`. We recommend the CSV approach for Policy Sets with more than 10 included Policies.
- EPAC continues to support deprecated elements `initiativeId`, `initiativeName` and `ignoreBranch`, Consider using their replacements `policySetId`, `policySetName` and `enforcementMode` instead.
- Role Assignments for user-assigned Managed Identities (UAMI) are not managed by EPAC, and will not generate a `roles-plan.json` file.
- `additionalRoleAssignments` are used when a resource required is not in the current scope. For example, a Policy Assignment that requires a Event Hub to be managed in a subscription not contained in the current management group.

> [!TIP]
> The tree is not required to be balanced. The number of levels is not restricted; however, anything beyond 3 levels is unnecessary in real scenarios and would be difficult to read and manage as the depth increases.

## Assignment Element and Metadata

Each Assignment is required to have a `name` which is used in its resource Id. EPAC also requires a `displayName`. The `description` is optional. For the allowed location assignment you specify the component with:

```json
"assignment": {
    "name": "allowed-locations",
    "displayName": "Allowed Locations",
    "description": "Sets the allowed locations."
},
```

Multiple `assignment` naming components in a tree branch are string concatenated for each of the three fields.

> [!WARNING]
> Azure has a limit of 24 characters for the concatenated `name` string. EPAC displays an error if this limit is exceeded. Azure also has a limit of 128 characters for `displayName` and 512 characters for `description` (For additional information see [Assignment Structure: Display name and description](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/assignment-structure#display-name-and-description)).

### Defining `metadata`

`metadata` is sometimes used to assign categories for changes. Do NOT specify EPAC-reserved elements `roles` and `pacOwnerId`. For the final `metadata` EPAC creates the union of instances in the entire tree branch.

```json
"metadata": {
    "category": "Security"
}
```

**Not recommended**: Adding `assignedBy` to the `metadata` overrides the `deployedBy` value from the `global-settings.jsonc` file normally used for `assignedBy`. It defaults to `"epac/$pacOwnerId/$pacSelector"`.

```json
"metadata": {
    "category": "Security",
    "assignedBy": "security-team@epac/epac/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/tenant"
}
```

### Metadata for Role Assignments

Role assignments do not contain a `metadata` field. Instead, the `description` field is used to populate the `deployedBy` value. The `description` field is populated with the Policy Assignment Id, reason and `deployedBy` value. This is useful for tracking the source of the Role Assignment.

Reasons is one of:

- `Role Assignment required by Policy` - Policy definition(s) specify the required Role Definition Ids.
- `additional Role Assignment` - from filed "additionalRoleAssignments" in the Policy Assignment file.
- `additional cross tenant Role Assignment` - from filed "additionalRoleAssignments" with `crossTenant` set to `$true` in the Policy Assignment file.

## Assigning Policy Sets or Policies

### Assigning a single Policy or Policy Set

Each assignment assigns either a Policy or Policy Set. In EPAC this is done with a `definitionEntry` or a `definitionEntryList`. Exactly one occurrence must exist in any collated tree branch. For each entry, you need to specify one of the following:

- `policyName` - custom Policy. Specifying just the name allows EPAC to inject the correct definition scope.
- `policySetName` - custom Policy Set. Specifying just the name allows EPAC to inject the correct definition scope
- `policyId` - resource id for builtin Policy.
- `policySetId` - resource id for builtin Policy Set.

`displayName` is an optional field to document the entry if the Policy name is a GUID. Builtin Policies and Policy Sets use a GUID.

```json
"definitionEntry": {
    "policySetName": "general-allowed-locations-policy-set",
    "displayName": "Use this if the Policy name is a GUID"
},
```

### Assigning multiple Policies or Policy Sets

Using `definitionEntryList` allows you to save on copy/paste tree branches. Without it, the number of branches would need to be duplicated as many times as the list has entries.

Each entry in the list creates an Assignment at each leaf of the tree. Since assignments must have unique names at a specific scope, the Assignment naming component must be amended for each list entry. In this sub-component you can decide if you want to concatenate the string by appending or prepending them by specifying `append` boolean value.

```json
"definitionEntryList": [
    {
        "policySetId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8",
        "displayName": "Azure Security Benchmark",
        "assignment": {
            "append": true,
            "name": "asb",
            "displayName": "Azure Security Benchmark",
            "description": "Azure Security Benchmark Initiative. "
        }
    },
    {
        "policySetId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/179d1daa-458f-4e47-8086-2a68d0d6c38f",
        "displayName": "NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5",
        "assignment": {
            "append": true,
            "name": "nist-800-53-r5",
            "displayName": "NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5",
            "description": "NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Initiative."
        }
    }
],
```

In the above example one of the children (leaf node) has the following Assignment name.

```json
"assignment": {
    "name": "pr-",
    "displayName": "Prod ",
    "description": "Prod Environment controls enforcement with "
},
```

This example generates two assignments at the "prod" leaf per scope:

- /providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/***Contoso-Prod***/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/**pr-asb**
  - `displayName` = "Prod Azure Security Benchmark"
  - `description` = "Prod Environment controls enforcement with Azure Security Benchmark Initiative."
- /providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/***Contoso-Prod***/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/**pr-nist-800-53-r5**
  - `displayName` = "Prod NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5"
  - `description` = "Prod Environment controls enforcement with NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Initiative."

## Assignment scopes and excluded scopes

`scope` is required exactly once in each tree branch. Excluded scopes (`notScope`) are cumulative from `global-settings.json` and the entire tree branch; however, once a scope is defined `notScopes` may not be defined at any child node.

Both `scope` and `notScopes` are specific to an [EPAC Environment using the pacSelector name](start-implementing.md#epac-concepts-and-environments), e.g., `epac-dev` and `tenant`.

```json
"scope": {
    "epac-dev": [
        "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/Epac-Prod"
    ],
    "tenant": [
        "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/Contoso-Prod"
        "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/Contoso-Prod2"
    ]
}
```

`notScopes` works the same. In addition `"*"` means all EPAC Environments.

```json
"notScopes": {
    "*": [
        "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/rg-pattern*"
    ],
    "tenant": [
        "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/<mg-id>"
    ]
}
```

## Managed Identities and role assignments

Policies with a `DeployIfNotExists` or `Modify` effect need a Managed Identity (MI) and role assignments to execute remediation tasks. EPAC calculates the necessary role assignments based on the `roleDefinitionIds` in the policy definition. By default EPAC uses a system-assigned Managed Identity. The team maintaining EPAC recommend using system-assigned identities; however, your organization may have role assignment reasons to use user-assigned Managed Identities.

### Defining `managedIdentityLocations`

Policy assignments requiring a Managed Identity (system-assigned or user-assigned) require a location `managedIdentityLocations`. You must specify the location based on EPAC Environment or use `"*"` to use the same location for all of the EPAC Environments.
You can specify them in `global-settings.jsonc` or at any node in the tree. The last (closest to the leaf node) is the one chosen if multiple `managedIdentityLocations` entries are encountered in a tree branch.

```json
"managedIdentityLocations": {
    "*": "eastus2"
},
```

### Defining optional `additionalRoleAssignments`

In some scenarios you will need `additionalRoleAssignments`; e.g., for diagnostics settings to Event Hubs, the target resource might be in a different Management Group and therefore the Managed Identity requires additional role assignments. You must specify the `additionalRoleAssignments` based on EPAC Environment or use `"*"`to use the same `additionalRoleAssignments`for all of the EPAC Environments.  If the pacEnvironment under deployment is specified in the additionalRoleAssignments, the `"*"` assignments will be ignored.

If the additional assignment is to made to a managing tenant in the scenario where the pacEnvironment under deployment is a managed (Azure Lighthouse) tenant, you must specify `""crossTenant": true"` for that assignment.  Ensure all necessary ABAC permissions are in place for the executing SPN.

```json
"additionalRoleAssignments": {
    "*": [
        {
            "roleDefinitionId": "/providers/microsoft.authorization/roleDefinitions/b24988ac-6180-42a0-ab88-20f7382dd24c",
            "scope": "/subscriptions/<id>/resourceGroups/<example>"
        }
    ],
    "prod": [
        {
            "roleDefinitionId": "/providers/microsoft.authorization/roleDefinitions/8e3af657-a8ff-443c-a75c-2fe8c4bcb635",
            "scope": "/subscriptions/<id>/resourceGroups/<example>"
        }
    ],
    "lighthouse": [
        {
            "roleDefinitionId": "/providers/microsoft.authorization/roleDefinitions/acdd72a7-3385-48ef-bd42-f606fba81ae7",
            "scope": "/subscriptions/945a01ac-ae61-41da-81b4-640a8441da7b",
            "crossTenant": true
        }
    ]
  },
```

### User-assigned Managed Identities

Azure Policy can use a user-defined Managed Identity and EPAC allows you to use this functionality. You must specify the user-defined Managed Identity based on EPAC Environment or use `"*"` to use the same identity for all of the EPAC Environments (only possible in single tenant scenarios). Within each EPAC Environment entry, you can specify just the URI string indicating to use the same identity even if we are using a `definitionEntryList`, or in the case of a `definitionEntryList` can assign a different identity based on the definitionEntryList by specifying a matching `policyName`, `policyId`, `policySetName` or `policySetId`.

```json
"userAssignedIdentity": {
    // For single definitionEntry or when using the same identity for all definitions being assigned
    "tenant1": "/subscriptions/id/resourceGroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/identity-1",
    "tenant2": [
      // differentiate by assigned definition
      {
          "policySetName": "somePolicySetName",
          "identity": "/subscriptions/id/resourceGroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/identity-2"
      },
      {
          "policySetId": "somePolicySetId",
          "identity": "/subscriptions/id/resourceGroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/identity-3"
      }
    ]
}
```

</br>

## Defining `parameters`, `overrides` and `nonComplianceMessages`

### Utilizing a CSV File to define `parameters`, `overrides` and `nonComplianceMessages`

Assigning single or multiple security and compliance focused Policy Sets (Initiatives), such as Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark, NIST 800-53 R5, PCI, NIST 800-171, etc, with just JSON parameters becomes very complex. Add to this the complexity of overriding the effect if it is not surfaced as a parameter in the `Policy Set`. Finally, adding the optional `nonComplianceMessages` further increases the complexity.

To address the problem of reading and maintaining hundreds or thousands of JSON lines, EPAC can use the content of a CSV file to create `parameters`, `overrides` and optionally `nonComplianceMessages` for a single Policy assignment `definitionEntry` or multiple Policy definitions (`definitionEntryList`).

> [!TIP]
> This approach is best for large Policy Sets such as Azure Security Benchmark, NIST 800-53, etc. Smaller Policy Sets should still be handled with JSON `parameters`, `overrides` and `nonComplianceMessages`.

Implement these steps as documented in [Managing Policy Assignment Parameters with a CSV file](policy-assignments-csv-parameters.md).

- Generate the CSV file from your already deployed Assignment(s) or Policy Set(s).
- Modify the effect and parameter columns for each type of environment type you will use.
- Modify the Policy Assignment file to reference the CSV file and the column prefix.
- Update the CSV file with the new effect and parameter values.

### Defining `parameters` with JSON

> [!WARNING]
> `parameters` have a simplified JSON structure. You do not need the additional `value` indirection that Azure requests (EPAC will inject that indirection).

```json
"parameters": {
  "aksClusterContainersAllowedImagesExcludedNamespaces": [
    "kube-system",
    "gatekeeper-system",
    "azure-arc"
  ],
  "kvKeysActiveMaximumNumberOfDays": 90,
  "publicNetworkAccessShouldBeDisabledForContainerRegistriesEffect": "Audit",
  "mysqlDisablePublicNetworkAccessEffect": "Deny",
  "kvRsaCryptographyMinimumKeySizeEffect": "Deny",
},
```

> [!NOTE]
> To enable `definitionEntryList`, parameters not present in the Policy or Policy Set definition are quietly ignored.

## Advanced Elements

### Defining `overrides` with JSON

`overrides` are in the same [format as documented by Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/assignment-structure#overrides-preview). They are  cumulative in each tree branch. The `selectors` element is only used for Assignments of Policy Sets. They are not valid for Assignments of a single Policy.

If using `definitionEntryList`, you must add the `policyName`, `policyId`, `policySetName` or `policySetId` as used in the `definitionEntryList` item.

```json
"overrides": [
    {
        "policySetId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/179d1daa-458f-4e47-8086-2a68d0d6c38f",
        "kind": "policyEffect",
        "value": "AuditIfNotExists",
        "selectors": [
            {
                "kind": "policyDefinitionReferenceId",
                "in": [
                    "331e8ea8-378a-410f-a2e5-ae22f38bb0da",
                    "385f5831-96d4-41db-9a3c-cd3af78aaae6"
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "policySetId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/179d1daa-458f-4e47-8086-2a68d0d6c38f",
        "kind": "policyEffect",
        "value": "AuditIfNotExists",
        "selectors": [
            {
                "kind": "policyDefinitionReferenceId",
                "in": [
                    "cddd188c-4b82-4c48-a19d-ddf74ee66a01",
                    "3cf2ab00-13f1-4d0c-8971-2ac904541a7e"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
],
```

### Defining `nonComplianceMessages` with JSON

Assign a non-compliance message to the assignment, or individual non-compliance messages if the assignment is for an Policy Set. This value is an array of objects - each containing a message, and in the case of an initiative a policyDefinitionReferenceId. See [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/assignment-structure#non-compliance-messages) for details.

If you use single `definitionEntry`, place them normally. If you use a `definitionEntryList` place them in the respective list entry.

```jsonc
"nonComplianceMessages": [
    {
        "message": "Update main message"
        // Default nonComplianceMessage
    },
    {
        "message": "Individual policy message",
        // Policy specific nonComplianceMessage. You must include the policyDefinitionReferenceId as defined in the Policy Set.
        "policyDefinitionReferenceId": "ASC_DeployAzureDefenderForSqlAdvancedThreatProtectionWindowsAgent"
    }
],
```

### Defining `resourceSelectors`

`resourceSelectors` may appear anywhere in the tree and are cumulative in any branch. [They follow the standard Azure Format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/assignment-structure#resource-selectors-preview).

```json
"resourceSelectors": [
    {
        "name": "SDPRegions",
        "selectors": [
            {
                "kind": "resourceLocation",
                "in": [ "eastus", "westus", "centralus", "southcentralus" ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Defining `enforcementMode`

`enforcementMode` is similar to the deprecated `ignoreBranch`; it deploys the assignment and sets the assignment to `Default` or `DoNotEnforce`. `DoNotEnforce` allows a what-if analysis. `enforcementMode` may appear anywhere in the tree. Definitions at a child override the previous setting.

```json
"enforcementMode": "DoNotEnforce",
```

## Example assignment files

### Simple Policy Assignment (Allowed Locations)

In the simple case an assignment is a single node with no difference in `assignment`, `parameters`, and `definitionEntry` across multiple scopes. In many scenarios "Allowed Locations" is such a simple Assignment. Such Assignments do not have child nodes, just the root node.
Example

```json
{
  "nodeName": "/root",
  "definitionEntry": {
    "displayName": "Allowed Locations Initiative",
    "policySetName": "general-allowed-locations-policy-set"
  },
  "assignment": {
    "name": "allowed-locations",
    "displayName": "Allowed Locations",
    "description": "Sets the allowed locations"
  },
  "metadata": {},
  "enforcementMode": "Default",
  "parameters": {
    "AllowedLocations": [
      "centralus",
      "eastus",
      "eastus2",
      "southcentralus"
    ]
  },
  "scope": {
    "epac-dev": [
      "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/Epac-Mg-1"
    ],
    "tenant": [
      "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/c"
    ]
  }
}
```

- `nodeName` is required for error messages; its value is immaterial. EPAC concatenates them in the current tree branch.
- `definitionEntry` specifies that the custom Policy Set `general-allowed-locations-policy-set` from our starter kit. `displayName` has no meaning - it is for readability and in this instance is superfluous.
- `assignment` fields `name`, `displayName` and `description` are used when creating the assignment.
- This assignment has no `metadata`. You don't need an empty collection. EPAC will add `pacOwnerId` and `roles` `metadata`. Do not add them manually.
- enforcementMode is set to default - it is superfluous.
- `parameters` are obvious. Note: you don't add the `value` layer Azure inserts - EPAC takes care of that.
- `scope`:
  - During Policy resource development (called `epac-dev`) the Assignment is deployed to an EPAC development Management Group `Epac-Mg-1`.
  - During Policy prod deployments (`tenant`-wide), it is deployed to the tenant Management Group `Epac-Mg-1`.
- No `notScope` entries are specified.

### Security-Focused Policy Assignment with JSON parameters

- In the following example we named our root node (`nodeName`) `/security/`. Since it is only used in case of error messages produced by EPAC during planning its actual value doesn't matter as long as its unique.
- We use a `definitionEntryList` to create two assignments at every leaf (six assignments total).
- For `assignment` string concatenation we append the strings in the `definitionEntryList` to the strings in the child nodes. You can see this best when you look at the `description` string in the child  nodes. It will form a sentence when concatenated by `append`ing the `definitionEntryList` `assignment` field `description`.
- The `parameters` specified in the children are specific to the IaC environment types and their `scope`. Note: a real assignment would define many more parameters. The set here is abbreviated since the actual set could easily exceed a hundred entries for each of the IaC environments. We'll see in the next example how to simplify large Policy Set parameters with a CSV file.

```json
{
  "nodeName": "/Security/",
  "definitionEntryList": [
    {
      "policySetId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8",
      "displayName": "Azure Security Benchmark",
      "assignment": {
        "append": true,
        "name": "asb",
        "displayName": "Azure Security Benchmark",
        "description": "Azure Security Benchmark Initiative."
      }
    },
    {
      "policySetId": "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/179d1daa-458f-4e47-8086-2a68d0d6c38f",

### Inverted Policy Assignment (Tag Inheritance and Required Tags)

As mentioned above sometimes it is advantageous (to reduce the number of repetitions) to turn a definition on its head:

- **Common** `parameters`, `scope`, `definitionEntryList` (with two Policies) at the root (`nodeName` is `/Tags/`).
- Start of the `assignment` strings (`append` is defaulted to `false`). Again look at description which will be a concatenated sentence.
- The children define the `tagName` parameter and the second part of the strings for `assignment`. The set of `parameters` is the union of the root node and the child node.
- This creates six Assignments (number of Policies assigned times number of children).
