# Policy Set (Initiative) Definitions

## Initiative (Policy Set) Definition Files

Policy Set definition files are managed within the the folder `policySetDefinitions` under `Definitions`. The definition files are structured based on the official [Azure Initiative definition structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/initiative-definition-structure) published by Microsoft. There are numerous definition samples available on Microsoft's [GitHub repository for azure-policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/tree/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions).

!!! note
    When authoring Policy or Policy Set definitions, check out the [Maximum count of Azure Policy objects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/overview#maximum-count-of-azure-policy-objects)

The names of the definition JSON files don't matter, the Policy Sets are registered based on the `name` attribute. The solution also allows the use of JSON with comments by using `.jsonc` instead of `.json` for the file extension.

**Optional:** Policy definition groups allow custom Policy Sets to map to different regulatory compliance requirements. These will show up in the regulatory compliance blade in Azure Security Center as if they were built-in. In order to use this, the custom Policy Sets must have both policy definition groups and group names defined.

* Policy definition groups must be pulled from a built-in Policy Sets such as the Azure Security Benchmark initiative ([Azure Initiative definition structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/concepts/initiative-definition-structure) published by Microsoft). There are numerous definition samples available on Microsoft's [GitHub Azure Security Benchmark Code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-policy/blob/master/built-in-policies/policySetDefinitions/Security%20Center/AzureSecurityCenter.json).
* Policy definition groups can be imported by using `importPolicyDefinitionGroups`. The following imports the groups from Azure Security Benchmark.

```json
    "importPolicyDefinitionGroups": [
      // built-in Policy Set definition (ASB v3)
      "/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/1f3afdf9-d0c9-4c3d-847f-89da613e70a8"
    ],
```

## Recommendations

* `"name"` is required and should be unique. It can be a GUID or a unique short name.
* `"category"` should be one of the standard ones defined in built-in Policies.
* Custom Policies: use `policyDefinitionName`. The solution constructs the `policyDefinitionId` based on the `deploymentRootScope` in `global-settings.jsonc`.
* Builtin Policies: use `policyDefinitionId`. The solution can constructs the `policyDefinitionId` from `policyDefinitionName` for builtin Policies; however using `policyDefinitionId` is more explicit/cleaner.
* Do **not** specify an `id`. The solution will ignore it.
* Make  the `effects` parameterized
