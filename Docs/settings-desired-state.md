# Desired State Management

> [!CAUTION]
> EPAC is a true desired state deployment technology. It takes possession of all Policy Resources at the `deploymentRootScope` and its children. It will delete any Policy resources not defined in the EPAC repo.

Desired State strategy enables you to adjust the default behavior to fit more complex scenarios, including shared responsibility scenarios. The use cases below show the archetypical use cases. For complex scenarios it is possible to combine multiple use cases.

## The `desiredState` Element

`pacEnvironments` must contain a `desiredState` element.

- Required:
  - `strategy`: The strategy to use for managing Policy resources. The following values are supported:
    - `full`: EPAC manages all Policy resources in the `deploymentRootScope` and its children. EPAC deletes any Policy resources not defined in the EPAC repo.
    - `ownedOnly`: EPAC manages only Policy resources defined in the EPAC repo. EPAC does not delete any Policy resources not defined in the EPAC repo.
  - `keepDfcSecurityAssignments`: It is recommended that Security and Compliance Initiatives are managed at management group levels with EPAC. Please read [Managing Defender for Cloud Assignments](settings-dfc-assignments.md).
- Optional:
  - `excludedScopes`: An array of scopes to exclude from management by EPAC. The default is an empty array. Wild cards are supported.
  - `excludedPolicyDefinitions`: An array of Policy Definitions to exclude from management by EPAC. The default is an empty array. Wild cards are supported.
  - `excludedPolicySetDefinitions`: An array of Policy Set Definitions to exclude from management by EPAC. The default is an empty array. Wild cards are supported.
  - `excludedPolicyAssignments`: An array of Policy Assignments to exclude from management by EPAC. The default is an empty array. Wild cards are supported.

The following example shows the `desiredState` element with all properties set:

```json
"desiredState": {
    "strategy": "full",
    "keepDfcSecurityAssignments": false,
    "excludedScopes": [],
    "excludedPolicyDefinitions": [],
    "excludedPolicySetDefinitions": [],
    "excludedPolicyAssignments": []
}
```

## Transitioning to EPAC

While transitioning to EPAC, existing Policy resources may need to be kept. Setting `desiredState` to `ownedOnly` allows EPAC to remove its own resources while preserving instances requiring (temporary) preservation.


```json
"desiredState": {
    "strategy": "ownedOnly",
    "keepDfcSecurityAssignments": false
}
```

After short transitioning period (weeks), it is recommended to set `desiredState` to `full` to allow EPAC to manage all Policy resources.

```json
"desiredState": {
    "strategy": "full",
    "keepDfcSecurityAssignments": false
}
```

## Exclude Resource Groups

> [!WARNING]
> **Breaking Change in v10.0.0:** Policy Assignments at resource groups are **managed** by EPAC. The element `includeResourceGroups` has been deprecated and removed.

To exclude resource groups from management by EPAC, add an `excludedScopes` array element with a wild card for the subscription and resourceGroups to `desiredState`. 

```json
"desiredState": {
    "excludedScopes": [
        "/subscriptions/*/resourceGroups/*"
    ]
}
```

## Use Case 1: Centralized Team

This original (previously the only) use case assumes one team/repo manages all Policies in a tenant or multiple tenants. Omit `desiredState` and `inheritedDefinitionsScopes`.

## Use case 2: Manage Policy Definitions, Assignments, or Exemptions differently

In some organizations the lifecycle of different parts may be managed separately. For example, you may want to manage Definitions and Assignments separately from Exemptions.

### Using Advanced CI/CD Pipelines (Recommended)

[Advanced CI/CD Pipelines with Release Flow](ci-cd-overview.md#advanced-cicd-with-release-flow) can be used to fast-track Exemptions while keeping a regular lifecycle for Definitions and Assignments. Script `Build-DeploymentPlans` has a parameter `BuildExemptionsOnly` to deploy only Exemptions.

### Using separate Repos

In some organizations the lifecycle of different parts may be managed separately. For example, you may have one repo to manage Definitions and Assignments separately from Exemptions. Changing `pacOwnerId` is not effective.

EPAC only manages items with a directory in the `Definitions` folder. Therefore, you can use the same `pacOwnerId` from two repos and remove the folders to separate them. In this example:

* Repo1: `Definitions` contains `policyDefinitions`, `policySetDefinitions` and `policyAssignments` folders.
* Repo2: `Definitions` contains `policyExemptions` folder.

Policy resource that would be defined in the folder. It is important to remove the folders. GitHub repos remove empty folder automatically.

If you have an empty folder or a folder with a file extension not recognized by EPAC, EPAC will delete any item which the folder could define from your environment.

## Use Case 3: Multiple Teams with Shared Responsibility

In a shared responsibility model multiple teams manage the same tenant(s) at the same scope. Additionally, a variant of this use case is well suited to what previously was called `brownfield` which needs to preserve Policy resources deployed prior to EPAC. The following diagram shows two EPAC solutions managing the same root (tenant). Other Policy as Code solutions can also participate if the solution sets `metadata.pacOwnerId`.

For standard behavior where each repo manages, no additional entries in `global-settings.jsonc` are necessary since the default strategy `full` is the default. `full` deletes any Policy resources without a `pacOwnerId`; however, id does not delete Policy resources with a different `pacOwnerId`.

## Use Case 4:  Multiple Teams in a Hierarchical Organization

The hierarchical model allows a central team to manage the commonality while giving parts of the organization a capability to further restrict resources with Policies. This is a common scenario in multi-national corporations with additional jurisdictional requirements (e.g., data sovereignty, local regulations, ...).

This is managed identical to use case 3.

> [!CAUTION]
> Previously, it was possible for a solution at a child scope to inherit Policy definitions form EPAC-A. This feature has been removed in v10.0.0 since it was not possible to manage the dependencies between Policy and Policy Set definitions and Policy Assignments correctly.
>
> To replicate the previous functionality, copy/replicate the custom Policy and Policy Set definitions files from EPAC-A repo to EPAC-C repo.

## Use Case 5: Exclude some Scopes and Policy Resources

In rare cases you may need to exclude individual child scopes, or Policy resources from management by an EPAC solution.

### Child Scope not Managed and Not Subject to these Policies

Child scope is managed by some other means. The use of a EPAC development Management Group under the same root is such an example. Another example is a child scope managed by a different organization not subject to the root scope Policies.

You use `globalNotScopes` to exclude a child scope from management by EPAC. The following example excludes the `childScope` from management by EPAC. See also [Global Settings](settings-global-setting-file.md)

```json
    "globalNotScopes": {
        "tenant": [
            "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/mg-policy-as-code"
        ]
    },
```

### Child Scopes not Managed by any EPAC repo but Subject to these Policies

This happens when EPAC `strategy` is `full` and some child scopes contain Policy resources not managed by an EPAC repo (delivered through some other deployment method). You can exclude them based on:

- Scopes (Management Groups, subscriptions and Resource Groups) through `desiredState.excludedScopes`
- Policy Definitions through `desiredState.excludedPolicyDefinitions`
- Policy Set Definitions through `desiredState.excludedPolicySetDefinitions`
- Policy Assignments through `desiredState.excludedPolicyAssignments`

You can exclude any combination of `excludedScopes`, `excludedPolicyDefinitions`, `excludedPolicySetDefinitions` and `excludedPolicyAssignments`. Any of the strings can contain simple wild cards.

```json
"desiredState": {
    "strategy": "full",
    "excludedScopes": [ // Management Groups, Subscriptions, Resource Groups
        "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/mg-policy-as-code/childScope"
    ],
    "excludedPolicyDefinitions": [
        "/subscriptions/*/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/childScope-policy"
    ],
    "excludedPolicySetDefinitions": [
        "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/mg-policy-as-code/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/pattern-policy-set-*",
        "/providers/Microsoft.Management/managementGroups/mg-policy-as-code/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policySetDefinitions/one-of-policy-set"
    ],
    "excludedPolicyAssignments": [
        "/subscriptions/*/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyAssignments/my-*"
    ]
}
```
