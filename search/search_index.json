If you are not seeing all of them, you may need to change your global filters.</p> <p>EPAC Setup for Each Target Subscription</p> <p>After the Lighthouse portion is complete you will need to set things up in EPAC for each target subscription.

The best way to perform mass deployments is through custom pipelines that create multiple plans with unique names and then run multiple deployments.

You may need to update this policy, for instance to add a new allowed IP address. This policy needs to be tested before it rolls out to any scope within your environment to ensure there's no issues and its behaving accordingly.</p> <p>The Solution: EPAC has the concept of EPAC Environments, or <code>pacEnvironments</code> providing isolated policy management with its own deployment scope.</p> <ul> <li>Each EPAC Environment has a symbolic name (<code>pacSelector</code>) and its own distinct <code>deploymentRootScope</code></li> <li>Each EPAC Environment is targeted separately for deployments, allowing you to manage policies independently.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"start-implementing/#typical-epac-environment-setup","title":"Typical EPAC Environment Setup","text":"<p>Each EPAC Environment provides isolated policy management with its own deployment scope.

Remember that EPAC expects to manage ALL policies within its <code>deploymentRootScope</code> and each <code>pacEnvironment</code> is independent, so creating an EPAC Environment that is nested within the <code>deploymentRootScope</code> of another EPAC Environment is generally not recommended.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Main pacEnvironment Name: You'll notice that we gave our main <code>pacEnvironment</code> the name <code>tenant01</code> instead of something like <code>production</code> and that \"EPAC Environment\" has been consistently bolded throughout the documentation. This is to create a distinction between environments that EPAC uses (<code>pacEnvironments</code>) and your general SDLC environments within your company (Prod, test, qa, dev, etc.) and Azure tenant. As discussed, it is important to separate the \"Development\" EPAC Environment from your regular development environments.</p>"},{"location":"start-implementing/#managed-identities","title":"Managed Identities","text":"<p>DeployIfNotExists (DINE) policies require a managed identity to function.
